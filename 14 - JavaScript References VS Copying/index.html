    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200; // if we change original number - the copy will remain unchanged

    age2 = 300; // if we change the copy - the original will remain unchanged
    console.log(age, age2);
    // copy strings and booleans the same as numbers

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; // this DOES NOT WORK with arrays!
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(players, team);
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = 'team2Name';
    console.log(team2);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[0] = 'team3Name';
    console.log(team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = 'team4Name';
    console.log(team4);
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[0] = 'team5Name';
    console.log(team5);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; // this DOES NOT WORK with objects!
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(captain2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
